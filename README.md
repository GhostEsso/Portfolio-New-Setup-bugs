# üìñ Portofolio: set up and mobile

> Description 

For this project, the goal is to figure out how to turn a Figma design into a functional user interface. For this, you will use Flexbox to place the elements on the page to create a personal portfolio website.

The site will be enhanced through the use of images and wallpapers to give a professional and attractive look. This project will allow you to practice your web development skills and learn how design skills can be applied to improve the look of your website.

By using Flexbox, you will learn how to position and align your website elements efficiently. You will also learn how to integrate images and wallpapers to bring your website to life. Once you complete this project, you will be able to create professional looking user interfaces using the techniques learned along the way.

before, you have to set up linters in your HTML and CSS project to improve the quality of your code and help catch errors and potential issues. Linters are tools that let you check your code to make sure it follows coding best practices, you will be able to improve the quality of your code and save time by avoiding common mistakes.
